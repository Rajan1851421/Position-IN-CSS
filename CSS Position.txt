1. Static:

The default position value is static. Elements with position: static are positioned according to the normal document flow.
They are not affected by top, bottom, left, right, or z-index properties.

<div class="static">
  <p>This is a static element.</p>
</div>
.static{
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
}

2. Fixed:
Elements with position: fixed are positioned relative to the browser window or the viewport. 
They remain fixed at a specific position, even when the page is scrolled.

<div class="fixed">
  <p>This is a fixed element.</p>
</div>
.fixed{
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
  padding: 10px;
}

3. Sticky:
Elements with position: sticky are positioned based on the user's scroll position. 
They behave like position: relative until they reach a certain scroll position, at which point they become sticky and remain fixed at that position

<div class="sticky">
  <p>This is a sticky element.</p>
</div>

.sticky{
  position: sticky;
  top: 50px;
  background-color: lightyellow;
  padding: 10px;
}


4. Relative:
Elements with position: relative are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow. 
You can adjust their position using top, bottom, left, and right properties.

<div class="relative">
  <p>This is a relative element.</p>
</div>
.relative{
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  background-color: lightpink;
  padding: 10px;
}

5. Absolute:
Elements with position: absolute are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor 
(or the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor is found). They are removed from the normal document flow.

<div class="main">
  <div class="absolute">
    <p>This is an absolute element.</p>
  </div>
</div>
.main{
  position: relative;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 10px;
}

.absolute{
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  right: 50px;
  background-color: lightcyan;
  padding: 10px;
}
